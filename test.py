# Sample Python code: Calculate the average of a list of numbers

# Define a function to calculate the average
def calculate_average(numbers):
    # Check if the list is empty
    if not numbers:
        return 0
    # Calculate the sum and divide by the length
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

# List of numbers
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40
